#SeleniumClickChecker5_MVP.java Usage Guide
This guide will help you understand how to use SeleniumClickChecker5_MVP.java, a program designed to automate the selection of elements in a web page using Selenium WebDriver.

#Getting Started
To use the program, you will need to have a working IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ. You will also need to have Selenium WebDriver installed and configured properly.

#Launching the Program
To launch the program, simply run the SeleniumClickChecker5_MVP.java file in your preferred IDE. This will launch a browser window and load the specified URL.

#Selecting Elements
Once the page has loaded, you can select elements by clicking on them. The selected element will turn green, indicating that it has been selected. If you select another element, the previous selection will turn blue to indicate that it has already been selected.

After you have selected all the desired elements, press 'Enter' in the console to generate the Page Object Model (POM) code for the selected elements. The POM code is a design pattern used in Selenium testing that allows for easier maintenance of the code. It creates a separate class for each page of the application, and the class contains the elements and their associated actions.

To continue selecting elements, rinse and repeat the process of selecting an element, waiting for it to turn green, and then selecting another one. Once you are satisfied with your selection, generate the POM code by pressing 'Enter' in the console.

#Generating Java Code
To generate the Java code for the selected elements, simply type 'exit' into the console and hit enter. The program will automatically generate the Java code for the selected elements and display it in the console.

#Running the Generated Code
Copy the generated Java code and paste it into a separate .java class file. Then, execute the code to automate the selection of elements in the web page.

As the code executes, a basic Spark report will be automatically created without any file dependencies. The HTML report is lightweight and can be easily shared via email or other means.

#Future Enhancements
In the future, we plan to add the capability to generate extend reports that take screenshots of the selected elements. We are also working on improving the current browser launch process to allow for sessions that are already running.
